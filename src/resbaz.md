# DIT4C & [ResBaz 2015][resbaz]

Running training sessions for 200 researchers requires a fair amount of grunt, and a high degree of redundancy to cope with failures.

Fortunately, DIT4C is designed to scale out.

## Resources

 * 5 platform nodes across 5 data-centres, including:
   * 5 routing nodes
   * 3 portal nodes
 * 10-20 compute nodes

## Clustering

A five node [etcd][etcd] cluster is capable of tolerating two lost nodes before it ceases to function. Prior to deploying DIT4C, a cluster of CoreOS VMs was set up across five [NeCTAR Research Cloud][nectar-rc] data-centres with &le;50ms ping times between them. [Flannel][flannel] was deployed to provide a private shared network between the nodes.

All five nodes were then deployed with routing containers, and three of the nodes with portal containers. A [cluster manager][cm] was used to monitor the portal containers and setup continuous replication between the three CouchDB instances.

Round-robin DNS was used to spread requests between the five compute nodes. The [dynamic reverse proxies][nginx-etcd-vhosts] spread requests between the three portal nodes and to the correct compute nodes for containers.

## High Availability

For domains with multiple A records, modern web browsers can try another server if they fail to get a response. This allows nodes in the cluster to reboot with minimal disruption to users.

Monitoring of the _"highcommand"_ portal servers is necessary to ensure Hipache doesn't continually try to contact dead servers.

For compute nodes, producing a HA solution was deamed too problematic, as multi-datacentre shared filesystems are not trivial deployments. Splitting compute nodes between multiple data-centres limits the damage from an outage instead.
