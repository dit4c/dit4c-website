# In Development

To run a minimal DIT4C environment in development, you need to run the following:
 * DIT4C portal
 * a DIT4C scheduler
 * Apache Cassandra
 * a CoreOS VM to serve as a compute node
 * a DIT4C image server (optional)

When running in production, you are will also need to run a DIT4C routing server. By using a helper that utilizes [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) we can avoid this requirement in development.

## Apache Cassandra

A database is required for both the portal and scheduler. Ensure Cassandra is available somehow on `localhost:9042`. By default, no authentication is expected.

From tarball or Debian package:
<http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/getting_started/installing.html>

Docker image:
<https://hub.docker.com/r/_/cassandra/>

# Scheduler keys

DIT4C schedulers use PGP keys for identification & auth. You will need to create a PGP primary key for each scheduler. We'll use `gpg2`.

First, we create a PGP primary key, solely for certification:
```
$ gpg2 --full-gen-key --expert

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

We then add two sub-keys for signing and authentication:

## CoreOS VM

In theory, you could use any VM that has systemd and [rkt](https://coreos.com/rkt/). In practice, it's simpler to use CoreOS. In production, you're likely to use [cloud-config](https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/cloud-config.html) or [Ignition](https://coreos.com/ignition/docs/latest/) to configure the reboot strategy, add SSH keys and mount storage, however the default config will work fine for development.

There are many ways to run a CoreOS VM on your desktop. One way that works quite well for DIT4C development is using QEMU:
<https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/booting-with-qemu.html>

Start the VM with a different port, as `2222/tcp` is used by the DIT4C portal:

```
./coreos_production_qemu.sh -p 2223 -nographic
```
